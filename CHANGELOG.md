# Changelog

All notable changes to Color Flow will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-28

### Added

- **Color Inheritance Support**: Elements now correctly inherit `color` properties from parent elements following CSS rules
- **Inherited Text Highlighting**: Elements without inline styles now have their text content highlighted with inherited colors

### Fixed

- **Word-Only Mode Missing Highlights**: Fixed issue where inherited text elements (like `<h2>` inside `<section>`) were not being highlighted in word-only mode
- **Incorrect Color Inheritance**: Fixed bug where child elements incorrectly inherited `background-color` from parents (background colors are not inherited in CSS)
- **Parent Color Overlapping**: Implemented range subtraction to prevent parent highlight colors from "bleeding" into child element areas
- **Char-Range Mode Alignment**: Fixed offset calculation using `endIndex` for more robust positioning, preventing shifted highlights
- **CRLF Line Ending Support**: Improved offset calculation to handle Windows CRLF (`\r\n`) line endings correctly

### Changed

- **Parser Logic**: Updated `onopentagname` event to calculate start positions from end indices for better accuracy
- **Text Node Tracking**: Elements now track individual text nodes with precise ranges for better highlight control
- **Highlight Priority**: Child element text colors now correctly take precedence over parent background colors

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-28

### Added

- **TSX/JSX File Support**: Extension now supports `.tsx` and `.jsx` files in addition to HTML, PHP, Vue, and Svelte
- **Enable Highlighting Setting**: New configuration option to enable/disable color highlighting (default: enabled)
- **Status Bar Indicator**: Visual status bar item showing extension state:
  - Shows enabled/disabled state with icon
  - Tooltip displays current status
  - Click to open Color Flow settings
  - Automatically updates when settings change
- **Improved Position Tracking**: HTML parser now uses accurate character-based positioning via VS Code's `positionAt()` API, fixing issues with incorrect highlight positions

### Fixed

- **Char-Range Highlight Mode**: Now correctly highlights the exact text range of element content, trimming leading and trailing whitespace
- **Word-Only Highlight Mode**: Now highlights individual words separately, skipping spaces between words
- **Full-Line Highlight Mode**: Now covers the entire width of each line from column 0 to end of line, including line breaks
- **Position Tracking Accuracy**: Fixed issues where highlights appeared at incorrect positions (e.g., on `<div style` instead of actual text content)
- **Multiline Text Support**: Improved handling of text content that spans multiple lines across highlight modes

### Changed

- **Settings Order**: Configuration properties reordered in settings UI for better organization:
  - "Enable Highlighting" moved to top
  - "Enable Border" placed before "Border Color"
- **HTML Parser**: Refactored to use `document.positionAt()` for accurate character index to position conversion
